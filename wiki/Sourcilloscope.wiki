#summary Description of Causeway's sourcilloscope visualization

<g:plusone size="medium"></g:plusone>

=== Sourcilloscope ===

The sourcilloscope visualization orients the events by their corresponding source code, a very familiar context for the developer. (The name is a play on _oscilloscope_ from electrical engineering.) The text outline view includes a top-level item for each source file referenced in the trace log; nested items are the individual source lines referenced by the top of call stack in each log record. This visualization is expressive and highly interactive.

_At a glance:_ You can see all events with the same top of stack, the number of communicating event loops, a visual indication of potential parallelism, the posting of an event handler and the firing of an event. As with the grid, you can track process order and message order.

_With a click:_ You can filter out source files or individual source lines. As with the grid, selecting an event on the scope highlights all causally-connected events in message order and shows the corresponding line of source code.

This expressive, elegant layout was designed and implemented by Alexy Agranovsky (UC Davis, while at Google) and Tyler Close (Google).
